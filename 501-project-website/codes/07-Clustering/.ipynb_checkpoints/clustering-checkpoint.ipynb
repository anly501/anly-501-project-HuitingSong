    "## Introducation to Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand this with an example. Suppose, you are the head of a rental store and wish to understand preferences of your costumers to scale up your business. Is it possible for you to look at details of each costumer and devise a unique business strategy for each one of them? Definitely not. But, what you can do is to cluster all of your costumers into say 10 groups based on their purchasing habits and use a separate strategy for costumers in each of these 10 groups. And this is what we call clustering.\n",

    "## Dataset Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Dataset of Residential power usage 3 years data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two datasets in total. The power usage data, extracted from “TRIEAGLE ENERGY LP, The Woodlands, Texas 77393”. and the historical weather data for Houston, Texas extracted from “www.wunderground.com”\n",
    "\n",
    "For the direction I want to study, I decided to use this ataset is because i want to know how residence use energy in time series. clustering can help me to cluster factors together in order to get more persuasive and accurate result to determine what energy consumption range resident usually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are too many factor or value influence the energy consumption, I categorize the value into three different groups in variable `usage`:\n",
    " - high (2): value in kWh >= 1.5 \n",
    " - low (0): value in kWh <= 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "also, for better utilize in the future, i convert the `notes` into factors 0-4:\n",
    "  - weekday : 0\n",
    "  - weekend : 1\n",
    "  - vacation : 2\n",
    "  - COVID-lockdown : 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In these datasets, we will use three kinds of methods of clustering and compare their accuracy and feasibility to determine which method is the most suitable to do clustering and reach conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three methods of clustering: K means / DBSAN / Hierachical clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process to clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering (k-means) is a clustering algorithm based on the division of the sample set. K-means clustering divides the sample set into k subsets, which constitute k classes, and divides n samples into k classes, each sample has the smallest distance to the center of the class it belongs to, and each sample belongs to only one class, which is k-means clustering, \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm works in these 5 steps :\n",
    "    1. Specify the desired number of clusters K\n",
    "    2. Randomly assign each data point to a cluster\n",
    "    3. Compute cluster centroids\n",
    "    4. Re-assign each point to the closest cluster centroid\n",
    "    5. Re-compute cluster centroids\n"

Also he can separate high density data into small clusters and can also cluster non-linear relationships (clustering to arbitrary shapes). However, it also has disadvantages because it is difficult to identify clusters in data of different densities, difficult to cluster high-dimensional data, and very sensitive to parameters of very small points.\n",

Hierarchical clustering methods decompose a given data set hierarchically until certain conditions are met. After distance values have been obtained, elements can be linked to each other. A structure can be constructed by separation and fusion. The method traditionally represented is a Tree data structure.\n",
