								<p><font size="4">Energy and environmental issues have always been a concern around the world. The United States, as the world's leading energy consumer and advocate of ecological conservation, has always had a long-term plan. As the population base and industrial structure change, energy demand and consumption are continuously growing. These increases are driving the nation's economic and national income growth. However, behind these increases, people are also facing the consequences of environmental degradation. So, in today's background where everyone is advocating energy conservation and environmental protection, are we really making a change?</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size="4">To this question, my answer is: "We are changing". From this study, people have their own ideas about environmental issues, at least people take to public platforms on Twitter to call for environmental protection and discuss energy issues. And from the point of view of people's electricity consumption habits, everyone is at a normal consumption level, and there is no serious unscientific way of consumption. People's electricity consumption habits will change with climate change, so some major energy consumption is inevitable. And, with the birth of new and clean energy sources, people are discussing energy conversion and considering the use of solar energy. These are things that we don't normally notice, but I felt them in this project. People are worried about environmental improvement, but they are also actively promoting and using new energy sources./font></p>

								<p><font size="6"><strong>Answering the 10 Questions</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size="4"><strong>1. What does increased energy consumption mean for people?</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size='4'>Traditionally, rising energy consumption can represent a variety of possibilities. For example, population growth, increased income or good economic conditions. For the general public, people may not be aware of what increasing energy consumption is all about. It's hard to perceive the meaning behind such a potentially abstract term when you're in the big picture. From the data I collected from Twitter users, we can see that people talk about energy consumption, but it is easy to see from the keyword associations that people discuss that the word energy consumption is still abstract and difficult for people to perceive. However, when I see from another data group that people are concerned about the environment and new energy sources, I think it shows that people are actually concerned about energy issues, but not energy consumption issues. They are more concerned about energy transformation and protecting the environment.</font></p>

								</div>
								<p><font size="4"><strong>2. Does clean energy matter for the environmental protection?</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size="4">In my second Twitter user data crawl, I used keywords like "oil", "gas", "solar power", "wind power", "environment" to scratch users' attitudes about these four kinds of energy. Oil and gas are energy in the traditional sense, while solar and wind are what we now call clean energy. In calculating and mapping the frequency of words in their informational texts, I found that solar power was discussed most often. We can also find other words in the cloud, such as 'lead coal' and 'expensive angry', which also indicate people's emotions and attitudes towards different energy sources. The emergence of these attitudes may also indicate a change in the way people view the types of energy sources nowadays. From once relying on traditional energy sources to now supporting clean energy sources, the awareness of environmental protection is growing. For the future, clean energy will occupy a larger and larger share of the market. The emergence of various new energy products, such as electric cars, and the widespread promotion of people from all walks of life, the use of new energy will only increase, so we can achieve the purpose of environmental protection by reducing harmful emissions from traditional energy sources.</font></p>

								<p><font size='4'><strong>3. Who contributes the most to energy consumption, residence, industry, or commercial?</strong></font></p>
								<div class="post-thumbnail-wrap">
									<div class="portfolio-box zoom-effect">
										<img src="images/Q3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
									</div>
								</div>
								<p><font size='4'>Based on the monthly energy consumption data provided U.S. EIA, Industrial sector attributes the most of energy consumption. While doing the data exploration, I also found a pattern or rule of energy consumption of different sectors. Industrial sector starts the consumption boost from the beginning of summer, but the consumption of residential and commercial sectors boots dramatically just in winter session. And comparing with the primary energy, End-Use energy is more widely used in all three different sectors. The End-Use energy includes the electricity, gasoline and natural gas. This indirectly indicates human actions still mostly rely on the End-Use energy which is more like from conventional energy. </font></p>
								<p><font size='4'><strong>4. How do people think about enviornment?</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size='4'>With this growing demand for energy, people are facing environmental and climate issues. The environmental problems directly related to energy production and consumption include air pollution, climate change, water pollution, thermal pollution, and solid waste disposal. The emission of air pollutants from fossil fuel combustion is the major cause of urban air pollution. Therefore, more and more people have started to publicize the dangers of global warming and call for the protection of the environment. And from the wordcloud graph above, you can still notice that people are concerning about the environment. </font></p>
								<p><font size='4'><strong>5. Which energy source will be consumed less in the next decade?</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size='4'><strong>6. What will the overall energy consumption level look like in the next decade?</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size='4'><strong>7. What will influence the energy consumption?</strong></font></p>
								<div class="post-thumbnail-wrap">
									<div class="portfolio-box zoom-effect">
										<img src="images/Q7.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
									</div>
								</div>
								<p><font size='4'>Actually, we know what kind of factors will affect our decision about how to use the energy. Like during the winter session we will turn on our heat to make us warm and the all-day long heating will make the energy consumption goes up. How much energy you use will be reflected on the utility bill every month you pay. From this project and the dataset about energy usage value (kWh) from Austin residence building, we can see that there is correlation between the usage value and the factors. For example, energy usage has positive correlation with Temperature. While temperature goes up, the energy consumption will goes up. </font></p>
								<p><font size='4'><strong>8. Will people choose new energy products? Such as electric cars?</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size='4'>For me, I would choose new energy products. The new energy we are talking about now is clean energy, like solar and wind. This kind of energy product can help relieve the pressure of environmental degradation to a certain extent. In recent years the expansion of new energy vehicles are becoming more and more popular with people. Not only can people relieve the "pressure on the gas meter" caused by the change in gas prices, but they can also have a superior means of transportation. And, from the analysis of people's attitudes toward clean energy, most people have a positive attitude toward clean energy. Then there is a great possibility that people will continue to choose new energy products in the future.</font></p>
								<p><font size='4'><strong>9. Can new energy replace traditional energy?</strong></font></p>
								<p><font size='4'>In general, the new energy industry can not replace traditional energy, but can only become a supplement to traditional energy, because there are many unresolved issues in the development of new energy. For example, the development of bioenergy can not affect human food demand, can not affect the food footprint; the development of coal-based alternative energy may face constraints of coal resources, water resources and environmental resources, but also face technical, financial and other The development of coal-based alternative energy may face constraints of coal resources, water resources and environmental resources, as well as technical and financial challenges, etc. Therefore, it is not yet possible to achieve the replacement of traditional energy sources by new energy sources, and the energy demand will depend on the supply of traditional energy sources for a long time in the future.</font></p>
								<p><font size="4">In fact, as you can see from the previous graph, people are still mainly dependent on traditional energy or end-use energy. Although people are now buying or experiencing new energy products, it is very difficult to achieve complete substitution in the real sense. In the case of oil, which is a global concern, the main reason why there is no alternative to oil is that it is a product of national and domestic economic, financial and political development. New energy can only reach the height of its existence in the market economy for now.</font></p>

								<p><font size="4"><strong>In my project, I still have some questions need to be addressed and analyzed (like the question 4,5,10). In the future study, I hope i will have the oppotunity to predict the energy consumption tendency for the next dacade. Finally, this project successfully investigate Twitter users' sentiment about energy consumption, energy type, and enviornment through implementing Naive Bayes and SVM model. And also, efficiently analyzing the correlation between energy consumption and different factors through using clustering adn ARM model. </strong></font></p>
